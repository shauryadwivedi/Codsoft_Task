# Credit Card Fraud Detection
# 📌 Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. Given the increasing number of online transactions, identifying fraud efficiently is crucial for financial security. The model is trained on a highly imbalanced dataset and optimized for high fraud detection rates while minimizing false positives.

# 🔍 Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and dealing with imbalanced data using SMOTE.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding transaction distributions, correlations, and fraud trends using visualizations.
Model Training & Evaluation: Implementing and comparing machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
Performance Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to assess model effectiveness.

# 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle, containing anonymized transaction data with features derived from PCA transformation.

# ⚙️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)
Libraries Used:
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn
Imbalance Handling: Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
